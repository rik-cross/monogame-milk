  summary: >-
    Represents a delegate for an easing function.

    An easing function takes a single float parameter (typically a normalized time value from 0 to 1)

    and returns a float value, which is the eased output.
  example: []
  syntax:
    content: public delegate float EasingFunctions.EasingDelegate(float t)
    parameters:
    - id: t
      type: System.Single
    return:
      type: System.Single
    content.vb: Public Delegate Function EasingFunctions.EasingDelegate(t As Single) As Single
